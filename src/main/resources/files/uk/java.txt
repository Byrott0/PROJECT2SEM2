Java Programming Language Documentation
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is renowned for its platform independence, allowing Java programs to run on any device or operating system equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Features of Java

Object-Oriented
Java supports the principles of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Platform Independence
Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any platform with a JVM, enhancing the portability of Java applications.

Memory Management
Java employs automatic memory management through garbage collection, preventing memory leaks and manual memory management errors.

Exception Handling
Java includes built-in support for exception handling, enabling developers to write robust code that can gracefully handle errors and exceptions.

Multithreading
Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. This is particularly useful for applications that require concurrent processing.

Java Libraries

Java Standard Library (Java SE)
The Java Standard Library provides a comprehensive set of classes and interfaces for common programming tasks, including I/O operations, networking, data structures, and utilities.

Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
Java EE extends the Java SE platform to support enterprise-level application development, offering APIs for building web-based applications, enterprise messaging, and distributed computing.

Apache Commons
Apache Commons is a collection of reusable Java components and utilities developed by the Apache Software Foundation, providing implementations for common programming tasks not covered by the standard Java libraries.

Java Development Tools

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Popular Java IDEs include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. These IDEs offer features such as code auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and project management, aiding developers in writing, debugging, and testing Java code.

Build Tools
Build tools like Apache Maven and Gradle automate the process of compiling, testing, and packaging Java applications. They manage dependencies, handle project configurations, and facilitate continuous integration.

Debugging Tools
Debugging tools such as Java Debugger (JDB), Eclipse Debugger, and IntelliJ Debugger are used by Java developers to identify and fix errors in their code. These tools allow setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping through code execution.
